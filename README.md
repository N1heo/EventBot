# EventBot
Telegram bot, that takes and saves event data.

The main code is in handlers/personal_actions.py
There we have all the so called 'handlers' which create all the commands, that bot can execute. 

To **boot** the bot, you only need to run 'bot.py'.

I was creating the bot without any venv, so here quickly all the libs, that I used:
- aiogram
- sqlite3
- datetime
